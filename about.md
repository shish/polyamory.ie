## About polyamory.ie

Shish registered this domain name because they saw that a shady-looking florida-based dating company had registered "polyamoryireland.com", and (maybe related, maybe not) somebody had also recently registered the facebook group "Official Polyamory Ireland" for the purpose of "Sexual Dating". This all seemed a bit sus, and the admins of the 15-year old "Polyamory Ireland" FB community weren't aware of it, so Shish decided to claim the _Most Totally Official-est_ "Polyamory Ireland" domain name, just to stop any corporations or creeps from getting their hands on it.

Polyamor.ie was also registered at the same time because Shish was in the middle of a COVID-fever brain-fog and thought that it was funny. That domain exists entirely for comedy value and may or may not be worth the â‚¬30/year fee to keep it running.

## About Shish

Shish is not an official representative of Irish Polyamorous people. There _is no_ official representative of Irish Polyamorous people. There is a community of wonderful peers, and some of us run events like support groups and picnics, and some of us have our own little chat groups and meetups -- anybody who claims to be more "official" than that is selling something :)
