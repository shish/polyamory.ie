What happens to your stuff when you die? I don't know.

I assume that by default it would go to your one official partner, or to children, with other partners getting nothing unless you specifically write a will. Is this correct? Can a lawyer chime in here? Can we get an example of "how to set things up so that your stuff is divided equally among all partners"?
