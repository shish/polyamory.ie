title: Don't Ask Don't Tell
aka:
- DADT
---
A style of polyamory were you and your partner don't discuss your other partnerships - you don't know who or how many people they are dating (if anybody at all), just that they will occasionally go off the grid and do their own thing sometimes.

Kind-of the opposite of [Kitchen Table](kitchen-table).
