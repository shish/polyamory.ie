title: Escalator
aka:
- Relationship Escalator
---
The idea that a traditional relationship will go through several [milestones](#Milestone),
in a set order, with each milestone being more "serious" than the last
(dating - "I love you" - marriage - living together - having children - dying together).

In monogamous relationships there is often an expectation that couples will
ride to the top of the escalator together - any relationship which doesn't
tick all of those boxes in that order is a failure, and it is a waste of time
to take the first step of "dating" if you don't intend to go all the way to
the end with that person.
