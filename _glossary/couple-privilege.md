title: Couple's Privilege
---
The idea that somebody in an "official" relationship is _inherently_ more valuable that somebody who is "just dating". Sometimes this is legitimate (somebody you share a bank account with probably _should_ have more of a say over your finances than an independent partner), sometimes less so (if you got drunk in Vegas and married a total stranger, it might not be the best idea to ditch your lifelong friends because "the label of 'spouse' means that they outrank you")
